CS 425: Final Project - Web Service Radio Station
Final Submission

Code Credit:
index.html
- Dennis McMeekan & Brandon Ahrens
Used a free startbootstrap HTML5 template - https://startbootstrap.com/template/modern-business
Learned Ajax Google API to call certain styles and formatting
Page that brings everything together

header/footer.html
- Dennis McMeekan & Brandon Ahrens
Very basic header and footer pages that are to be implemented with each webpage
Researched previous projects to see how they were used with AngularJS

logo, newlogo, and oldlogo.svg
- Dennis McMeekan & Brandon Ahrens
Attempted to use online formatting to ensure SVG graphics were exactly how we wanted.
Logo, and oldlogo both didn't format properly in terms of actual code so I scratched them.
Newlogo is what is currently used and properly formats each shape to exact SVG measurements.

connectToDB, getSongs.php, queries.php
- Dennis McMeekan & Brandon Ahrens
Research on using PHP, beyond what was previously provided through this course by Dr. Binto George.
Homepage for Research - https://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp
Needed to connect, pull, and query songs and data from the database.

404, about, home.html
- Dennis McMeekan & Brandon Ahrens
Expanded upon the template provided by StartBootStrap
Needed to research basic HTML5 audio - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_audio.asp
Each aspect of ourwebpage, broken down into partial to better understand and implement

main, player, songInfo.js
- Dennis McMeekan & Brandon Ahrens
Main.js specifically came from template, to ensure that configuration and routes of the webpage were correct.
Modified to our needs and specifications.
Player.js involved expanding upon HTML5 audio and adding certain functions based on MySQL database information
songInfo.js similar to player.js, but instead of focusing on certain play function, requires backend to actual load
and open/send data. player.js adds functionality of continuous play of songs and setting up first song.
